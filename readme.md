</br> ## Features(Core model)
- **Data Loading**: Loading FITS files with accurate metadata extraction
- **Contrast enhancement**: Linear stretching is used to implement contrast enhancement and dynamic range compression is implemented using astropy and numpy
- **Image alignment and reprojection**: Performed using numpy
- **Wavelength based colorization**: Algorithms from sci-kitlearn are used for assigning different colours to different wavelengths
- **Layer blending for final composite creation**: Layers of all images obtained across all spectrums from JWST's sensors are superimposed to form one final composite image, ready for analysis.

## ✨ Features(Web interface)

- **📤 Image Upload**: Drag-and-drop or click to upload astronomical images
- **🖼️ Live Preview**: Real-time image preview before analysis
- **🤖 AI Analysis**: Simulated AI-powered image analysis with detailed insights
- **📊 Detailed Reports**: Comprehensive analysis including:
  - Image quality assessment
  - Detected celestial features

```

## 🔌 API Integration (Future Enhancement)

To connect with a real AI API:

### Using Claude API
```javascript
async function analyzeImage() {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            model: 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229',
            messages: [{
                role: 'user',
                content: [
                    {
                        type: 'image',
                        source: {
                            type: 'base64',
                            media_type: 'image/jpeg',
                            data: currentImage.split(',')[1]
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        type: 'text',
                        text: 'Analyze this astronomical image...'
                    }
                ]
            }]
        })
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    displayResults(data);
}
```

### Using OpenAI Vision API
```javascript
async function analyzeImage() {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
            model: 'gpt-4-vision-preview',
            messages: [{
                role: 'user',
                content: [
                    { type: 'text', text: 'Analyze this astronomical image' },
                    { type: 'image_url', image_url: { url: currentImage } }
                ]
            }]
        })
    });
    const data = await response.json();
    displayResults(data);
}
```
